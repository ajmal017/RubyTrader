RubyTrader
==========

A beginning and continuous development of a Stock or Commodities Trading platform and simulator.

RubyTrader is the beginning development of a Trading Simulator and Trading Platform built in Ruby and eventually displayed in some GUI.

	Its key features right now are being able to:
		-Load DATA in the form of CSV
		-Add Indicators or Strategies (strategies use indicators)
		-Create BUY/SELL and/or SHORT/COVER points
		-Add a beginning account value 
		-Be able to see how much money you would have made or lost.
		-Export a report with parameter inputs exported to EXCEL
		-Apply different forms of money management for exponential growth


Future ideas will be allowing "Portfolio Trading" in which you trade multiple instruments within a given time frame

Future future ideas will be hooking this up to something like Interactive Brokers API for actual real order entries and exits.
